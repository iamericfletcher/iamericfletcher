### Hi, I'm Eric ðŸ‘‹

I am an enthusiastic and detail-oriented [Executive Assistant](https://hbr.org/2011/05/the-case-for-executive-assistants), team player, and communicator within the areas of Finance, Education, and Information Technology. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a concentration in Certified Financial Planning. I am well versed in adaptability, time management, collaboration, anticipating needs, communication, entrepreneurship, and decision making with a strong commitment to customer service and helping others to get things done.

Figuring out where I can add value is one of my guiding principles. My motivation to succeed, enthusiasm to communicate and learn, and love of problem-solving allow me to step into any situation.

I am also busy teaching myself the `R` and `Python` programming languages. My focus lies in understanding statistical analysis, data manipulation, and data visualization. My overarching goal is to deepen my problem solving skills while continuing to broaden my administratively focused skill set with the ability to harness data science techniques to help my Executive, or fellow team members, derive insight from data. Eventually, I would also like to inspire other administrative professionals to learn how to code!

Other hobbies of mine include running, biking, swimming, and jump roping.
