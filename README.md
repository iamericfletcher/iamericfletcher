I am an enthusiastic and detail-oriented [Executive Assistant](https://hbr.org/2011/05/the-case-for-executive-assistants), team player, and communicator within the areas of Finance, Education, and Information Technology. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a concentration in Certified Financial Planning. I am well versed in adaptability, time management, collaboration, anticipating needs, communication, entrepreneurship, and decision making with a strong commitment to customer service and helping others to get things done.

Figuring out where I can add value is one of my guiding principles. My motivation to succeed, enthusiasm to communicate and learn, and love of problem-solving allow me to step into any situation. 

In my free time, I am busy teaching myself the `R`, `Python`, `JavaScript`, `C#`, and `C++` programming languages. My overarching goal is to deepen my problem-solving abilities while broadening my administratively focused skill set with the ability to harness data science techniques to help my Executive, or fellow team members, derive insight from data. Eventually, I would also like to inspire other administrative professionals to learn how to code!

Other hobbies of mine include running, biking, swimming, and jump roping.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on `R` or `Python` projects.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He, Him, His
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was the first male diver at Pace University!
